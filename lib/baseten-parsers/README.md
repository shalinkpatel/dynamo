# Baseten parsers

`baseten-parsers` provides one request-scoped Rust stream for ordered visible
text, reasoning, and tool-call events. Python exposes it as
`dynamo.parsers.UnifiedParserStream`. Construct one stream per response choice,
call `step` for each decoded text delta, and call `finish` at end of stream.

The `backend` argument selects the Rust parser implementation:

- `dynamo` (default) uses `dynamo-parsers-v2` 0.7.7 from
  `michaelfeil/frontend-crates` revision
  `79b3c206fc7af040e64572f5a630d6348d05a5b5` (the draft
  [remaining frontend-crates fixes](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/frontend-crates/pull/301)).
  Available families are in `UNIFIED_PARSER_FAMILIES`. Harmony (`harmony`,
  `gpt_oss`, `gpt-oss`) uses the v1 gpt-oss reasoning and Harmony tool parsers
  from that same revision.
- `vllm` uses vLLM's native unified Rust parsers at revision
  `f84325c48c0acc1e3703103788c5f2976e719762`. Available families are in
  `VLLM_UNIFIED_PARSER_FAMILIES`. Supply a local `tokenizer.json` path with
  `tokenizer_path`; vLLM uses it to resolve model markers and prompt state.
  Its native unified families are `gemma4`, `hy_v3`, `hy_v4`, `inkling`, and
  `kimi_k3`. vLLM currently accepts `prompt_token_ids` and native tool output;
  the Dynamo-specific `starting_state`, guided JSON, and invalid-payload
  policies are rejected for this backend.

```python
from dynamo.parsers import UnifiedParserStream

parser = UnifiedParserStream("qwen3", tools=tools)
# For vLLM: UnifiedParserStream("gemma4", tools=tools,
#                               backend="vllm", tokenizer_path="/model/tokenizer.json")
events = parser.step(delta_text)
events += parser.finish()
# event.kind: text | reasoning | tool_call
# event.text for text/reasoning; event.call for tool_call
```

Tool definitions use the flat upstream shape, with `name`, `parameters`, and
optional `description` and `strict`. Tool argument fragments are ordered and
must be concatenated by call index. A `complete` call delta marks closure.
`preserve_special_tokens` indicates whether the decoder must retain marker
text. `ParserStreamError.events` contains events committed before an error;
errors and `finish()` close the stream.

`ToolCallStream` remains importable from `dynamo.parsers` and `dynamo._core`
for compatibility, but construction raises `RuntimeError`. The standalone
`ReasoningParserStream` has been removed. Importing `dynamo.parsers` itself
does not load the native extension; the extension loads when a live parser,
constant, or exception is requested.

Run `cargo test -p baseten-parsers` for the Rust adapter checks. The Python
binding smoke checks are in `lib/bindings/python/tests/test_b10_parsers.py`.

## Harmony (gpt-oss)

```python
import dynamo.parsers as parsers

parser = parsers.UnifiedParserStream("harmony", tools=tools,
    prompt_token_ids=rendered_prompt_token_ids)
```

The prompt must end with an assistant generation prefix. With no prompt tokens,
`starting_state="none"` expects the continuation of an assistant header, such as
`<|channel|>analysis<|message|>`. `reasoning` and `response` start directly inside
those channels. Keep Harmony special tokens in decoded output. The adapter normalizes HF
spellings (`<|im_start|>`, `<|meta_sep|>`, etc.) to v1's canonical `<|start|>`, `<|channel|>`, `<|message|>`, `<|end|>`, `<|call|>`,
and `<|return|>` spellings.

The adapter preserves v1 semantics: text/reasoning stream incrementally, calls
are buffered until `<|call|>` and emitted as complete calls with stable IDs, and
unfinished calls are dropped at EOF. It preserves v1's separators between repeated
channels. Guided JSON is rejected; forced tool output must retain native Harmony
envelopes. V1's internal parsing/recovery behavior is unchanged, including its
handling of malformed input; this adapter does not add stricter validation.

The serving layer still owns generation stops, prompt rendering, and finish
reasons. This adds a selectable Rust parser, not a replacement of Baseten's Python
Harmony processor or a claim of gpt-oss model-serving parity.

## Kimi K3 argument streaming

Select `baseten_kimi3_streaming` with the `dynamo` backend to emit native K3
tool arguments chunk by chunk:

```python
parser = UnifiedParserStream("baseten_kimi3_streaming", tools=tools)
events = parser.step(delta_text)
```

It accepts the same K3 XTML input as `kimi_k3`, including reasoning, response,
call IDs, typed arguments, and raw JSON. Tool names appear at the call header;
string values are JSON-escaped as they arrive, and typed JSON values also
stream before their closing marker. Concatenate argument fragments by tool
index. A fragment can contain an unfinished JSON string or value; `complete`
becomes true when the call validates. Interpretation and execution of partial
values belong to the consumer.

The parser retains the original call buffer for validation and holds potential
structural markers until it can distinguish them from literal data. Malformed
or truncated input can fail after fragments have been emitted. Duplicate keys
and invalid typed JSON that require rewriting prior output fail rather than
revising committed fragments. Handle `ParserStreamError.events` explicitly.
Guided JSON delegates to the ordinary upstream K3 parser and its configured policy.
The existing `kimi_k3` selector keeps buffered-call behavior. This selector is
available through the Rust/Python stream adapter; serving integration remains
owned by the caller, as for the other unified families above.

### Ownership and dependency upgrades

`baseten_kimi3_streaming` is implemented locally in `src/kimi3/` and uses only
upstream's public `UnifiedParser` and event contracts. It does not require a
streaming constructor in frontend-crates or a permanently customized dependency
revision. The existing frontend-crates dependency remains at its pre-streaming
version/revision and can be upgraded independently.

- `native.rs` contains the native K3 grammar extracted from frontend-crates
  0.7.7 at revision `79b3c206fc7af040e64572f5a630d6348d05a5b5`, with source
  provenance and Apache-2.0 attribution. Guided routing was excluded.
- `streaming.rs` contains the local incremental argument projection, sharing
  marker/header helpers with the native grammar.
- `mod.rs` implements the public parser lifecycle and delegates guided JSON to
  upstream. `tests.rs` retains native grammar regressions and streaming tests;
  `tests/kimi3.rs` checks adapter-level guided parity and prefilled channels.

When upgrading frontend-crates, review upstream K3 native changes against this
snapshot, port applicable fixes deliberately, and run `cargo test -p
baseten-parsers --locked`. Streaming parity compares valid native output against
the current upstream parser across every UTF-8 split, while guided parity checks
each chunk and error policy. This keeps the maintenance scope to K3; the rest
of frontend-crates continues to come from the normal dependency.
